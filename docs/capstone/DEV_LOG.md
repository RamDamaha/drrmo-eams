# Development Log

One entry per merged story. Format in ../DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md section 4.

## 2026-11-05 · Planning and scaffold (core)
- What was built: planning documents, Laravel 13 and React 19 scaffold, CI, workflow docs
- Decision and why: one Laravel app serving one React SPA with two layouts, because the user base is about 60 people and a single server is enough
- Decision and why: Laravel Sail for local development, because XAMPP still ships PHP 8.2 and Laravel 13 needs 8.3
- Evidence: docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, first CI run on main
- Paper: Chapter 3 (development model, tools and technologies)
